# OppNet
OrganiCity - OppNet Application

* The opportunistic network enabler uses smartphones and IoT devices to build a dynamic wireless communication ‘infrastructure’ at an OC partner site
* The software component that enables opportunistic communication will allow the smartphones of OC participants and IoT devices to become part of the networking infrastructure at OC partner sites.
* At an initial stage, the opportunistic networking component will be provided as an independent middleware.
* Finally, this component will also be integrated with the smartphone experimentation tool;
* This will enable OC users to activate and utilize opportunistic network enabler as a service and to control its execution parameters.
